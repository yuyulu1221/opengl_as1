### Anime:
- Normal: The robot stands in a normal pose
- Exercise: The robot moves its arms rhythmically in a set of four. On the third motion, it squats down. This was inspired by my dadâ€™s exercise routine.
- Super: The robot raises both hands to a 45-degree angle towards the upper right. The right knee bends, shifting the weight to the right. Since the design is based on Franky, this signature pose is a must-have.
